    "Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or decisions about a population based on sample data. It starts with a null hypothesis (H0), which represents a default stance or no effect, and an alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha), which represents what we aim to prove or expect to find. The process involves using sample data to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, based on the likelihood of observing the sample data under the null hypothesis.

    "\n",
    " 1. Gather the necessary data required for the hypothesis test.\n",
    " 2. Define Null (H0) and Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha).\n",
    " 3. Choose the Significance Level (α), which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n",
    " 4. Select the appropriate statistical tests. Examples include t-tests for comparing means, chi-square tests for categorical data, and ANOVA for comparing means across more than two groups.\n",
    " 5. Perform the chosen statistical test on your data.\n",
    " 6. Determine the p-value and interpret the results of your statistical tests"

    "So, Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or decisions about a population based on sample data. It starts with a null hypothesis (H0), which represents a default stance or no effect, and an alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha), which represents what we aim to prove or expect to find. The process involves using sample data to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, based on the likelihood of observing the sample data under the null hypothesis."
